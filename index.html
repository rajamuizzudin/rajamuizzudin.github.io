Over the past year, we’ve seen an influx of “behind the scenes” artists break through as soloists. From the likes of Julia Michaels, ROZES to Emily Warren these artists have dedicated years of their lives writing songs for other people, but in turn have decided to use their talent to make a career for themselves in their own right.

Another artist who’s recently made their solo breakthrough is KUIZZ, a singer, songwriter and producer from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Over the years, he has been busy songwriting and producing for others, working with multiple award winning artists such as Canadian Juno Award Winners; Mia Martina, Danny Fernandes & Kristinia Debarge to name a few. His writing talents have been recognised in both Canada and Japan, achieving chart success in the process. Whilst studying at the SAE Institute in Melbourne, KUIZZ later caught the attention of a music publisher in Los Angeles.

After dedicating much of his time to writing and producing for other Artists, last year KUIZZ decided to put his personal music first and pursue a solo career. In September of 2016, he debuted his very first self produced and written EP Till The End.
